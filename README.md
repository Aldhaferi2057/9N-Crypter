This is my second tool, 9N Crypter. I had it uploaded to my Discord server. The tool is programmed in Python. For those who don't know its purpose, the idea behind this tool is that you can place a payload file for any malware program or any program you need to encrypt. For example, a program that displays false warnings (only fake ones). This program is supposed to be for the payload, but you can use this method with it. From the Browse button, you place the actual payload or any file you want to encrypt. You can add an icon if you want. Then, click Crypt, and the tool will encrypt it. Of course, it will take a short time because it's programmed in Python, and Python takes time to create .exe files, but don't worry, it won't take long.

If the tool doesn't work or the Crypt button doesn't work, download Python, open the command prompt (cmd), and type: `pip install setuptools` or `pip install pyinstaller`. Now try the tool. If it still doesn't work, contact me on Discord. User w5vi

And I'll solve the problem for you simply.

Reminder: The tool is not the source code; the tool is .exe.
